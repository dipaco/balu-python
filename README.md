# balu-python
Python implementation of Balu Toolbox by Domingo Mery (http://dmery.ing.puc.cl/index.php/balu/)

# Installation:
You can install balu-python with pip just by typing the command:
`pip install balu`
We recommend to use a virtual environment to isolate the library from the system installed packages.
