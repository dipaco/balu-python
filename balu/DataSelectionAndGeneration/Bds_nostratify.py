        Data Sampling without Stratification (without replacement)

        input: (X,d) means features and ideal classification
        Bnostratify takes randomily a portion s (s between 0 and 1) of the
        whole that without considering the portion of each class
        from (X,d) to build (X1,d1). The samples not used in (X1,d1) are
        stored in (X2,d2).
