- There is an interesting web page about command equivalency in python for Matlab users:
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html

- To maintaing consistency through the code, every new command should be implemented in its own .py file. Then
  the correspondent __init__.py file should included like this:

  from .Bft_pca import Bft_pca

  This way we about long importing lines.

- Before releasing a new command all the examples in the command's documentations should work according with Balu
  philosophy.
